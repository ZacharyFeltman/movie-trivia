# Movie Quiz
Using HTML and JS I have created a movie themed quiz. When user starts, they have an allotted time to answer the given questions. They lose time for incorrect answers, and are prompted to enter their initials with their score at the end.

## Objectives

 - When start. button is selected, user is presented with questions and a timer.
 - Once a question is answered, then. the next questions appears on the screen.
 - If user answers incorrect, 5 seconds are deducted from the time.
 - The game ends when user finishes all of the questions, or time runs out.
 - When game is over, user can enter initials to save last score.
